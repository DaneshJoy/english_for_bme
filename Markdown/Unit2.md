### II. Reading

**Electroencephalography in Biomedical Engineering**

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a key technique in biomedical engineering that measures and records the **electrical activity of the brain**. It provides insight into how the brain functions by detecting the tiny voltage changes produced by **neurons**. The recorded signal, known as an **electroencephalogram**, is represented as a series of waveforms that vary in **frequency** and **amplitude**.

To acquire EEG signals, **electrodes** are placed on the scalp using a standardized system such as the **10–20 electrode placement** method. Each electrode detects voltage fluctuations that reflect brain activity beneath that area of the cortex. Biomedical engineers work on developing precise **signal acquisition** systems that reduce **artifacts** caused by movement, eye blinks, or external electrical noise.

EEG waveforms are classified into several types according to frequency:

- **Delta     (0.5–4 Hz):** deep sleep
- **Theta     (4–8 Hz):** drowsiness or meditation
- **Alpha     (8–13 Hz):** relaxed state
- **Beta     (13–30 Hz):** alertness and mental activity
- **Gamma     (>30 Hz):** cognitive processing and attention

Each type of brainwave indicates a different state of consciousness or brain function. Abnormal EEG patterns can help diagnose **epilepsy**, **sleep disorders**, **brain injuries**, and **neurological diseases**.

Modern EEG systems use **digital signal processing** and **machine learning algorithms** to automatically detect **seizures**, monitor sleep stages, and analyze cognitive states. Engineers also develop **brain-computer interfaces (BCIs)** that translate brain signals into commands to control external devices, such as wheelchairs or robotic arms. These technologies are vital in **neurorehabilitation** and assistive communication.

In clinical and research settings, EEG provides a non-invasive and cost-effective way to monitor brain activity. It plays an essential role in both **diagnosis** and **therapy**, contributing to advances in neuroscience, psychology, and biomedical engineering.

In conclusion, **electroencephalography** bridges the gap between engineering and neuroscience. By designing accurate acquisition systems and intelligent signal analysis tools, biomedical engineers enable deeper understanding of the brain and develop innovative solutions for neurological care.

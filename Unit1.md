### II. Reading

**Electrocardiography in Biomedical Engineering**

Electrocardiography (ECG) is one of the most common diagnostic techniques in medicine. It records the **electrical activity** of the heart over time and provides valuable information about its rhythm and function. The recorded signal is called an **electrocardiogram**, which displays characteristic waves representing different phases of the cardiac cycle.

A standard ECG system uses several **electrodes** placed on the patient’s chest and limbs to detect voltage differences produced by the heart’s electrical impulses. Each pair of electrodes forms a **lead**, and the combination of multiple leads offers a complete picture of heart activity. Biomedical engineers design these systems to minimize **artifacts** caused by movement, electrical noise, or poor contact.

The ECG waveform typically includes the **P wave**, **QRS complex**, and **T wave**. The P wave indicates **atrial depolarization**, the QRS complex corresponds to **ventricular depolarization**, and the T wave represents **ventricular repolarization**. By analyzing these waveforms, clinicians can detect **arrhythmias**, **ischemia**, and other **cardiac abnormalities**.

Modern ECG systems use **digital signal processing** to filter noise, enhance signal quality, and automatically detect irregularities. Biomedical engineers develop **algorithms** for **real-time monitoring** and **data interpretation**, helping physicians make faster and more accurate diagnoses. Portable and wearable ECG devices allow **continuous heart monitoring**, which is especially important for patients with chronic cardiac diseases.

In research, ECG signals are used to study the **correlation** between physiological and psychological conditions. Machine learning models are also applied to predict potential cardiac events based on large ECG datasets. Thus, **electrocardiography** serves not only as a diagnostic tool but also as a foundation for innovation in **biomedical engineering**.

In conclusion, ECG technology represents a vital link between **engineering** and **medicine**. Biomedical engineers contribute by improving **signal acquisition**, **noise reduction**, and **automated analysis** systems, making cardiac care more accurate, efficient, and accessible.

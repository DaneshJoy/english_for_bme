### **II. Reading**

**Medical Nanotechnology and Nanodevices**

Medical **nanotechnology** focuses on designing and using materials at the **nanoscale**, typically less than 100 nanometers, to solve clinical problems. At this small size, materials show unique **physical**, **chemical**, and **biological** properties that can improve diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of diseases.

One of the most important applications is **targeted drug delivery**. Traditional medications spread throughout the body, which can reduce their effectiveness and increase side effects. **Nanoparticles** and **nanocarriers** can transport drugs directly to diseased tissues such as tumors. These nanosystems often include **surface modifications** that help them recognize specific cells. As a result, the drug is released precisely where it is needed, improving treatment outcomes and minimizing damage to healthy tissue.

Nanotechnology is also transforming **medical imaging**. Structures like **quantum dots** and specialized contrast agents provide brighter, clearer images in MRI, CT, and fluorescence imaging. Their small size allows them to circulate easily in the bloodstream and attach to biological targets, enabling earlier and more accurate diagnosis.

Another rapidly developing area is **biosensing**. **Nanodevices** can detect extremely small amounts of biomarkers in blood or saliva, allowing for early detection of diseases such as cancer or infections. These sensors are highly sensitive because nanomaterials interact strongly with biological molecules.

Researchers are even exploring **nanorobots** that could one day repair tissues, remove blood clots, or deliver drugs inside individual cells. Biomedical engineers design these systems by combining **biocompatible materials**, computational modeling, and advanced manufacturing techniques.

Despite their promise, nanomaterials require careful testing. Potential risks include **cytotoxicity**, accumulation in organs, and long-term effects that are not yet fully understood. However, ongoing innovation and regulation continue to move medical nanotechnology toward safe and widespread clinical use.

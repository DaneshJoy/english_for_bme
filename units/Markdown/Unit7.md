### II. Reading

**Neuroengineering and Brain-Computer Interfaces**

**Neuroengineering** is an interdisciplinary field that combines neuroscience, electrical engineering, and computer science to study and interact with the nervous system. One of its most advanced applications is the **Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)**, which enables direct communication between the brain and an external device.

A **BCI** detects **neural signals** using **electrodes** placed either on the scalp (noninvasive) or directly on the brain surface (invasive). These signals are **acquired**, **decoded**, and translated into commands that control devices such as robotic arms, computers, or prosthetic limbs. BCIs help individuals with paralysis or limb loss regain **motor control** and independence.

Biomedical engineers play a key role in **signal acquisition**, **feature extraction**, and **algorithm design** to interpret brain activity accurately. They also design **feedback systems** that allow users to receive sensory information from the controlled device, creating a closed-loop interaction.

Recent advances include **adaptive BCIs**, which learn from the user’s neural patterns to improve performance over time. **Neural stimulation** techniques are also used for rehabilitation, helping restore movement or sensory function in patients with neurological injuries.

Despite major progress, BCIs face challenges such as signal noise, long-term stability, and **ethical** questions regarding privacy and cognitive influence. However, as technology evolves, neuroengineering promises to revolutionize healthcare by bridging the gap between the human brain and machines.

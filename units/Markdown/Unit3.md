### II. Reading

**Microcontrollers in Biomedical Engineering**

A **microcontroller** is a small computer on a single integrated circuit containing a **processor**, **memory**, and **input/output (I/O)** ports. It is designed to perform specific control tasks within larger systems, often as part of an **embedded system**. In biomedical engineering, microcontrollers are essential components of modern **diagnostic**, **monitoring**, and **therapeutic** devices.

Microcontrollers are used to control and process signals from various **biomedical sensors**, such as temperature sensors, heart rate monitors, and oxygen saturation probes. The collected data is processed and displayed in real time, allowing clinicians to make accurate and timely decisions. For example, a microcontroller in a **patient monitoring system** reads ECG or pulse data, converts it from **analog to digital**, and transmits it for further analysis.

Biomedical engineers use microcontrollers in **infusion pumps**, **ventilators**, **prosthetic limbs**, and **wearable health devices**. In prosthetics, for instance, the microcontroller interprets muscle or nerve signals and activates the **actuator** to move an artificial limb. In ventilators, it adjusts airflow and pressure based on patient feedback to maintain proper breathing support.

Programming is a crucial part of microcontroller design. Engineers write **embedded software** to define how the system responds to inputs and controls outputs. **Feedback loops** are used to maintain stability and precision — a key feature in critical medical systems. For example, in an insulin pump, the microcontroller continuously measures glucose levels and adjusts insulin delivery automatically.

Modern microcontrollers offer **wireless communication**, enabling **Internet of Medical Things (IoMT)** devices that send data to healthcare databases or cloud systems for remote monitoring. They must also meet strict standards of **reliability**, **safety**, and **power efficiency**, especially for life-support and implantable devices.

In conclusion, microcontrollers form the backbone of biomedical instrumentation. Their integration with sensors, actuators, and communication modules enables intelligent, efficient, and portable medical devices. Biomedical engineers play a vital role in programming, testing, and optimizing these systems to ensure patient safety and high performance.

**Medical Imaging Systems**

Medical imaging systems allow physicians to visualize internal body structures without surgery. These **noninvasive** technologies have transformed diagnosis and treatment, offering clear and detailed insights into anatomy and function. The main **modalities** include **X-ray radiography**, **computed tomography (CT)**, **magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)**, **ultrasound**, and **positron emission tomography (PET)**.

**X-ray imaging** uses controlled radiation that passes through the body, creating a **radiograph** based on tissue density differences. It is fast, inexpensive, and widely used for bones and chest examinations. However, excessive radiation exposure must be minimized.

**Computed tomography (CT)** extends X-ray imaging by rotating the source around the body to create multiple cross-sectional images. These are **reconstructed** by computer into 3D models, providing detailed information about internal organs and blood vessels.

**Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)** does not use ionizing radiation. Instead, it relies on **magnetic fields** and **radio waves** to produce high-resolution images of soft tissues like the brain, muscles, and joints. MRI is particularly useful for neurological and musculoskeletal studies.

**Ultrasound imaging** employs **high-frequency sound waves** transmitted into the body. The reflected echoes are converted into images, making this method safe for fetal monitoring and organ assessment. It is portable, low-cost, and real-time.

**PET imaging** involves the detection of radioactive tracers injected into the body. It provides functional information about metabolism and is commonly combined with CT for detailed anatomical and physiological mapping.

Biomedical engineers contribute to imaging through system design, **signal processing**, **artifact reduction**, **image reconstruction**, and the development of **contrast agents**. They also ensure **safety standards** and optimize **image quality** for accurate **diagnosis**.

In summary, medical imaging systems merge physics, biology, and engineering to create technologies that save lives. Continuous innovation in digital imaging and computer analysis makes diagnosis faster, more accurate, and less invasive.

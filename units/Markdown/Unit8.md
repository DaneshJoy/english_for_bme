### II. Reading

**Virtual and Augmented Reality in Medicine**

**Virtual Reality (VR)** and **Augmented Reality (AR)** are transforming modern medicine through immersive visualization and interactive learning. **VR** creates a completely digital environment that users experience through **headsets** and controllers, while **AR** overlays computer-generated images onto the real world.

In medical **education**, VR allows students to explore **3D anatomical models**, perform simulated surgeries, and practice procedures safely before operating on real patients. This **simulation-based learning** improves understanding, confidence, and motor skills.

In clinical **applications**, AR helps surgeons visualize organs and tissues in real time during operations. By projecting 3D anatomical overlays onto the patient’s body, AR systems enhance **navigation**, **precision**, and reduce surgical errors. **Interactive interfaces** and **gesture control** allow hands-free manipulation of medical data during surgery.

VR and AR are also valuable in **therapy and rehabilitation**. Virtual environments motivate patients during physical or cognitive recovery, making therapy more engaging and effective. For example, stroke patients can practice limb movements in a VR game setting to accelerate progress.

Biomedical engineers develop VR/AR systems by integrating **tracking sensors**, **display technologies**, and **software algorithms** to achieve realistic and responsive experiences. Challenges include **cost**, **motion sickness**, and **data accuracy**, but continuous innovation promises wider use in training, diagnostics, and remote medical collaboration.

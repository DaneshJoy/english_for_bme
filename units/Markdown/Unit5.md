### II. Reading

**Robotic Surgery in Biomedical Engineering**

Robotic surgery is an advanced form of **minimally invasive surgery** in which surgeons use computer-controlled robotic systems to perform operations with high precision. Instead of working directly over the patient, the surgeon sits at a **console** and manipulates robotic arms equipped with surgical **instruments**. These instruments often have greater **dexterity** and **articulation** than the human hand, allowing for smoother and more controlled movements inside the body. Robotic surgery integrates engineering, medicine, and computer science to improve surgical performance and patient outcomes.

In a typical robotic platform, the surgeon’s hand movements are captured at the console and translated into smaller, more precise actions by the robot. This process, known as **motion scaling**, enables delicate manipulation of tissues and structures that would be difficult to handle with traditional surgical tools. Through **teleoperation**, surgery can even be performed remotely, enabling expert surgeons to operate on patients in distant locations.

**Biomedical engineers** are essential in designing, calibrating, and maintaining surgical robots. They develop control algorithms, mechanical structures, and **feedback** systems to ensure smooth and accurate movement. A key feature is **haptic feedback**, which provides the sensation of touch or resistance, helping surgeons judge the force applied to tissues and improving procedural safety.

While global systems such as the **da Vinci** robot are widely recognized, a significant development in recent years has been the emergence of **Sina Robotic Surgery**, an advanced robotic surgical platform developed in Iran. The **Sina** system offers high-precision robotic arms, 3D **visualization**, tremor reduction, and finely articulated instruments designed for minimally invasive procedures. One of its notable strengths is its focus on adaptable engineering: biomedical engineers can modify and upgrade components locally, allowing continuous improvement and cost-effectiveness compared to imported systems. The Sina platform supports procedures in fields such as urology, gynecology, and general surgery, and serves as an important example of how regional innovation can expand access to high-quality robotic surgery.

Despite its advantages, robotic surgery—including systems like **Sina**—faces several challenges. These platforms are expensive to build and maintain, and surgeons need extensive training to operate them safely. Regular **sterilization**, hardware checks, and software updates are essential to ensure **accuracy** and patient safety. Ongoing research in biomedical engineering aims to reduce system costs, improve reliability, and incorporate **AI-assisted automation** to support surgeons in complex tasks.

In summary, robotic surgery demonstrates how the combination of mechanical precision, computer control, and biomedical expertise is transforming modern medicine. With the rise of innovative systems such as **Sina Robotic Surgery**, access to advanced, minimally invasive procedures continues to grow, and future platforms may achieve even higher levels of **autonomy** and efficiency.
